// eg: I want to convert the cursor'x x position into a hue value
// if my window is 768px wide, my cursor's possible range is 0 - 768
// a hue value has a range of 0 - 360
// i could run remapRange(mouseXPos, 0, 768, 0, 360) which would remap the ranges
// eg if my mouse is halfway across the screen, where mouseXPos would equal 384, the 
// above function would return 180 as it's halfway through the second range


/* takes a single number value and returns a hsl colour value */
/* saturation and lightness are set to a default but this can be changed */
